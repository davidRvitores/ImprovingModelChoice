The file algorithms.R contents the algorithms to fit the models G-CPC and G-PROP for model-based clustering and discriminant analysis. In addition, the external libraries needed are also loaded in the header. The script includes both auxiliary functions, main function for fitting the models, and supplementary functions to represent or asses the adequacy of the models. For each function, a brief explanation is given. However, to understand the usable functions, more direct instructions and axamples are given in the examples in the workflow.
